  \item The HIV-1 epidemic:
    \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep4pt
      \item 1.5 million new infections occurring annually worldwide;
      \item new infections outpace patients starting antiretroviral therapy;
      %\item $<$40\% efficacy rate for \textit{most efficacious} preventive
        %vaccine.
      \item HIV Vaccine Trials Network's (HVTN) \textit{505} trial evaluated a
        novel antibody boost vaccine~\citep{hammer2013efficacy}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item The COVID-19 \sout{epi}~\sout{pan}~endemic~\citep{antia2021transition}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep4pt
      \item \sout{270} \sout{331} \sout{619} \sout{643} 686 million total cases
        detected globally;
      \item new variants emerging, with vaccine uptake globally slowing;
      %\item $\sim$95\% efficacy rate for \textit{most efficacious} vaccine(s).
      \item COVID-19 Prevention Network's (CoVPN) \textit{COVE} trial focused
        on Moderna's (mRNA-1273) vaccine~\citep{baden2021efficacy}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{center}

\note{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Baseline covariates($L$): sex, age, BMI, behavioral HIV risk.
  \item Intervention(s) ($A$): post-vaccination T-cell activity markers.
  \item Outcome ($Y$): HIV-1 infection status at week 28 of tiral.
  \item 12-color intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay.
  \item Cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with
    synthetic HIV-1 peptide pools.
  \item A vaccine effective at preventing HIV-1 acquisition would be a
    cost-effective and durable approach to halting the worldwide epidemic.
  \item The study was halted on 22 April 2013 due to absence of vaccine
    efficacy. There was no significant effect of the vaccine on the primary
    infection endpoint of HIV-1 infection between week 28 and month 24.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Did we have the time? Polio (7 years), Measles (9 years),
    Chickenpox (34 years), Mumps (4 years), HPV (15 years).
  \item How did we make it? Typical process timeline (73 months) replaced by an
    \textit{accelerated} process of 14 months.

\begin{frame}[c]{Why Measure and Analyze Immune Correlates?}

\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep8pt
  \item Two interrelated goals of immune correlates analyses are to
    \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep0pt
      \item identify/validate possible \textit{surrogate
        endpoints}~\citep{prentice1989surrogate};
      \item understand/delineate \underline{\textit{protective mechanisms}} of
        vaccines.
    \end{itemize}
  \item If an immune correlate is established to reliably predict VE,
    subsequent efficacy trials may use it as a primary endpoint.
  \item This may accelerate the approval of
    \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep0pt
      \item existing vaccines in different populations (e.g., in children);
      \item new vaccines within the same class (e.g., based on mRNA);
      \item inform the development of ``next-generation'' vaccines.

\begin{frame}[c]{Measuring Correlates: Two-Phase Designs}

\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}

    \item Often, use case-cohort design~\citep{prentice1986case}, a special
      case of two-phase sampling~\citep{breslow2003large}.
    \item Phase 1: measure baseline, vaccination, endpoint on everyone.
    \item Phase 2: given baseline, vaccine, endpoint, select members of
      immune response subcohort with (possibly known) probability.
      \vspace{-1em}
      \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep4pt
        \item \textit{505}: second-phase sample with 100\% of HIV-1 cases and
          matching of non-cases~\citep[$n = 189$ per][]{janes2017higher}).
        \item \textit{COVE}: stratified random subcohort ($n \approx 1600$) and
          all SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease endpoints.

    \mathcal{M}$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep4pt
      \item $L$ (baseline covariates): sex, age, BMI, behavioral HIV risk,
      \item $A$ (treatment): randomized assignment to vaccine/placebo,
      \item $S$ (exposure): immune response profile for relevant markers,
      \item $Y$ (outcome of interest): infection status at trial's end.

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $\pi_0 \coloneqq \pr(B = 1 \mid Y, L)$ must be \textit{known by

\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep8pt
  \item Describe the manner in which $X$ is hypothetically generated by a
    nonparametric structural equation model~\citep{pearl2009causality}:
    \begin{equation*}
      L = f_L(U_L); A \sim \text{Bern}(0.5);
      S = f_S(A, L, U_S); Y = f_Y(S, A, L, U_Y)
    \end{equation*}
  \item Implies a model for the distribution of counterfactual RVs induced by
    interventions on the system under study.
  \item A \textit{static} intervention replaces $f_S$ with a specific value $s$
    in its conditional support, i.e., $S \mid L$.
  \item This requires specifying \textit{a priori} a particular value of
    exposure under which to evaluate the outcome --- but what value?

\begin{frame}[c]{Controlled vaccine efficacy (CVE)}

\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}

  \item For a hypothetical value $s \in \mathcal{S}$, the \textit{controlled
    direct effect} (CDE) quantifies the effect of $A$ on $Y$ while fixing
    $S = s$.
  \item The hypothetical value $S = s$ must be chosen carefully --- to
    be scientifically informative \textit{and} to avoid positivity violations.
  \item For two hypothetical values $s_0, s_1 \in \mathcal{S}$,
    \textit{Controlled Vaccine Efficacy} (CVE)~\citep{gilbert2022controlled} is
  \begin{equation*}
    \text{CVE}(s_0, s_1) = 1 -
      \frac{\E[\pr(Y = 1 \mid S = s_1, A = 1, L = l)]}
      {\E[\pr(Y = 1 \mid \cancel{S = s_0}, A = 0, L = l)]} \ ,
  \end{equation*}
  which contrasts counterfactual risk for vaccine and $S = s_1$ vs.~placebo
  and $S = s_0$, where $s_0 = 0$ by construction.

\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep8pt
  \item Stochastic interventions modify the value $S$ would naturally assume by
    \textit{shifting} the natural exposure distribution.
  %\item Consider the post-intervention value $S_{\delta} \sim g_{\delta}(\cdot
    %\mid L)$; static interventions are a special case (degenerate distribution).
  \item \cite{diaz2012population, diaz2018stochastic}'s shift
    interventions\footnotemark
     \begin{equation*}\label{shift_intervention}
       d(s, l) =
         \begin{cases}
           s + \delta, & s + \delta < u(l) \quad (\text{if plausible}) \\
           s, & s + \delta \geq u(l) \quad (\text{otherwise})
         \end{cases}
     \end{equation*}
  %\item Such an intervention generates a counterfactual random variable
    %$Y_{g_{\delta}} \coloneqq f_Y(S_{\delta}, L, U_Y)$, with distribution
    %$P_0^{\delta}$, .
  %\item We aim to estimate $\psi_{0,\delta} \coloneqq \E_{P_0^{\delta}}
    %\{Y_{g_{\delta}}\}$, the counterfactual mean under the post-intervention
    %exposure distribution $g_{\delta}$.
  \item Our estimand is $\psi_{0,\delta} \coloneqq
    \E_{P_0^{\delta}}\{Y_{d(S,L)}\}$, which is identified by
    \begin{align*}\label{eqn:identification2012}
      \psi_{0,\delta} = \int_{\mathcal{L}} \int_{\mathcal{S}} &\E_{P_0}
        \{Y \mid S = d(s, l), L = l\} \\ &g_{0, S}(s \mid L = l)
        q_{0, L}(l) d\mu(s)d\nu(l)
    \end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{center}

\note{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For HVTN 505, $\psi_{0,\delta}$ is the counterfactual risk of HIV-1
      infection, had the observed value of the immune response been altered
      under the rule $d(S,L)$ defining $g_{\delta}(\cdot \mid L)$.

        L_i) + D^{\star}_n(O_i).
      \end{equation*}
  \item The TML estimator updates initial estimates of $\overline{Q}_n$ by
      tilting:
    \begin{equation*}\label{tmle}
      \psi_n^{\star} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n

    \item Both estimators are CAN even when nuisance parameters are estimated

  \item \textit{Proposal:} Characterization of stochastic interventions as
    \textit{modified treatment policies} (MTPs).
  \item Assumption of \textit{piecewise smooth invertibility} allows for the
    post-intervention distribution of any MTP to be recovered:
    \begin{equation*}
      g_{0, S}(s \mid l; \delta) = \sum_{j = 1}^{J(l)} \mathbb{I}_{\delta, j}
      \{h_j(s, l), l\} g_0\{h_j(s, l) \mid l\} h^{'}_j(s, l)

  \item MTPs account for the natural value of exposure $S$ yet may be
    interpreted as imposing an altered intervention mechanism.
\end{itemize}
\end{center}

\note{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shifts of the form $\delta(S, L)$ are considerably more interesting
      since these are realistic intervention policies.
    \item Example: consider an individual with an extremely high immune response
      but whose baseline covariates $L$ suggest we shift the response still
      higher. Such a shift may not be biologically plausible (impossible, even)
      but we cannot account for this if the shift is only a function of $L$.
    \item The authors build IPW, outcome regression, and non-iterative doubly
      robust estimators, as well as an approach based on MSMs.
    \item Piecewise smooth invertibility: This assumption ensures that we can
      use the change of variable formula when computing integrals over $S$ and
      it is useful to study the estimators that we propose in this paper.

  \item Using all observed units ($X$), estimate sampling mechanism
    $\pi(Y, L)$, perhaps using data-adaptive regression methods.
  \item Using only observed units in the second-stage sample $C = 1$,
    construct initial estimators $g_n(S,L)$ and $\overline{Q}_n(S,L)$,
    weighting by the sampling mechanism estimate $\pi_n(Y,L)$.
  \item With the approach described for the full data case, compute
    $H_n(s_i,l_i)$, and fluctuate submodel via logistic regression.
  \item Compute IPCW-TML estimator $\Psi_n$ of the target parameter, by solving
    the IPCW-augmented EIF estimating equation.
  \item Iteratively update estimated sampling weights $\pi_n(Y,L)$ and
    IPCW-augmented EIF, updating TMLE in each iteration.
\end{enumerate}
\end{center}

\note{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We recommend using nonparametric methods for the initial estimators,
      as consistent estimation is necessary for efficiency of the estimator
      $\Psi_n$.
    \item Intuition for the submodel fluctuation?
    \item This process includes the use of HAL to fit the regression of the EIF
      contributions on the sampling node $\{Y, L\}$.
