## Abstract (1497/1500 characters)

In clinical trials randomizing participants to active vs. control conditions and
following units until the occurrence of a primary clinical endpoint, evaluating
the efficacy of a quantitative treatment (e.g., drug dosage) is often difficult.
Stochastic-interventional effects, which measure the causal effect of perturbing
the treatment's observed value, provide an interpretable solution; yet, their
use in vaccine trials requires care, for such trials measure immunologic
biomarkers -- useful for understanding the mechanisms by which vaccines confer
protection or as surrogate endpoints -- via outcome-dependent two-phase sampling
(e.g., case-cohort) designs. These biased sampling designs have earned their
popularity: they circumvent the economic burden of measuring biomarkers on all
study units without limiting opportunities to detect mechanistically informative
biomarkers. We discuss a semiparametric biased sampling correction allowing for
asymptotically efficient inference on a causal vaccine efficacy measure, defined
by contrasting assignments of study units to active vs. control while also
shifting observed biomarker expression in the active condition, yielding
a causal dose-response analysis informative of next-generation vaccine efficacy
and of transporting efficacy from a source pathogen strain (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 at
outbreak) to variants of concern (e.g., Omicron BA.5). We present the results of
applying this approach in the Moderna COVE COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trial.
